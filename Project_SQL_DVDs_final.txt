	JOIN film_category fc
		ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
	JOIN film f
		ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
	JOIN inventory i
		ON i.film_id = f.film_id
	JOIN rental r
		ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
		
	WHERE c.name = 'Animation' OR
		c.name = 'Children' OR
		c.name = 'Classics' OR
		c.name = 'Comedy' OR
		c.name = 'Family' OR
		c.name = 'Music'
